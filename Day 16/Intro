How to Review Pitch Decks
These are the core areas to look at while analyzing decks:

- What is the problem they are solving? How many people have and experience this problem?
- Market size - How large is the Total Addressable Market and Serviceable Obtainable Market?
- Who is in the team? Are they competent? Trustworthy?
- Does the business model look valid and scalable?
- Do they understand their competition? What is their Unique Value Proposition?
- What do their financials look like?
