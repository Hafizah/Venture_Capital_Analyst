Day 1: Getting into Venture Capital 

Hey Everybody,

It’s so great to have you as a part of our Venture Capital Experience. 

Let's start with a fun fact. 

Did you know that global venture funding went up 4 percent year over year to [$300 billion in 2020](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-2020-funding-and-exit/) :exploding_head:

Yes, that's a big number. So are the opportunities to work in this space. 

VC is one of the most challenging but rewarding industries to work in. With that in mind, I hope you’re ready to embark on an incredible journey of learning and doing with me. 

This course will bring forth the knowledge stack to help you break boundaries and prepare to take the ultimate plunge in the world of Venture Capital. 

As a precursor, this will be the longest email you receive from me. 

From now on, you can expect a message each day, providing you with a short intro to the topic, recommended readings and a task to go through every few days.

I will also be asking for quick feedback as we proceed to improve your experience.

As we are working through this course step-by-step, we will begin very slowly as I introduce you to how the industry works in the first week. 

However, over time as you continue to make progress through this course expect that I will raise the bar.

For today, there's 2 articles to read and a 40-min video to know all about Venture Capital:
