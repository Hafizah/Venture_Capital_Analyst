Link: Medium - Looking to get into VC? 4 Questions you need to ask before you start your search

1. Are you interested in an investment or platform role?
2. Do you want to join an early-stage fund or later-stage growth fund?

Early-stage investing is what we do at Lerer Hippeau. We’re usually the first institutional check into a company. 
At this stage, some companies are pre-product or pre-launch and many are too early to have substantial traction or profits. 
At this point, you’re investing based on people, markets, and ideas or technologies.
Later stage funds are much more data driven. Late-stage companies have substantial operating and financial data, 
and your job as an investor is to evaluate the company, the model, and the opportunity for incremental value or growth.

3. Are you interested in a specific area of investing?


4. What kind of team culture are you looking for?

 If you’re interested in platform, always ask what role you play in the investment process. 
 Do you get to participate in partner meetings? Or bring new companies to the table?
