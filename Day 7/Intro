Analyzing the Market and Customers**

To do an in depth market analysis, we need to find the TAM, Market Size and Customer Perceptions. 

1. Total Addressable Market - tells us how much growth potential is on the horizon for the industry and is an excellent metric to look at when trying to gauge a startup’s growth potential.

    The total amount of money you can make selling what you’re selling is called the total addressable market, also known as total available market, or TAM for short.

    How to calculate:

    - [Market Analysis for Early Stage entrepreneurs and VCs](https://medium.com/entrepreneurship-at-work/the-importance-of-market-analysis-for-early-stage-entrepreneurs-vcs-2217a168cb18)

2. Market Size 
What are the total amount of sales and customers in your industry of choice each year? 

3. Customer Perceptions

    This is about what an industry's customers (and potential customers) think.

    Think about which surveys have taken place in your industry of choice, which may impact the market?
