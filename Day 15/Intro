Due diligence is an investigation of the target company. 

The first funding rounds for a startup are often supported by private individuals called angel investors, rather than VCs or large corporations. 
Angel investors often invest on their own accounts and view risk differently than venture capitalists.

VCs must perform thorough due diligence of the operating business, whereas angel investors should undertake soft due diligence to see 
if the business project and the team match their investment-risk comfort level.

Contrary to investing in asset-heavy industries, the asset in startups will often be a synthesis of the CEO, team, idea, customers, and traction. 
It’s indeed fragile. 

Typical checks point for soft diligence are:

- **Team** – Get to know the team and the CEO, their ability, and their commitment to the business.
- **Market Size** – Who are the competitors, and what edge is needed to succeed?
- **IP rights** – Do they have full control over IP, code, logos, and relevant domains?
- **Code review** – Is the code well written, and is the platform scalable?
- **Budget and forecasts** – Check if they are in control of the financials.
- **Traction** – Investigate actual revenue growth, user growth, retention, churn, etc.
- **Online Profile** – What image do they convey – e.g. do they attract followers on social media?
- **Contracts** – Review the essential customer/employee/vendor contracts.

Your Due Diligence should be an exhausted source for other firms to look at and accept as a source of verified information. 

If DD isn't done well, there is a good chance the firm's reputation could be at significant risk. 
This is usually all kept in a data room and if not organized well it can often prolong the process, sometimes resulting in the loss of a deal.
